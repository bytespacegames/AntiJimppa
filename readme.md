# AntiJimppa
so some dude named Jimppa loves harrassing people on Loyisa's Test Server so I made a module that hides him and optionally prevents you from seeing his messages (kinda like a client side /ignore)

using the AddIgnore.java file, you can also hook it up to ignore more than just Jimppa, assuming you have a command system

this was made pretty poorly (just removes the player entity from the world), but it works for my needs so idc.
